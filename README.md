- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kino24
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded software and programming in general!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and possibly C# because I want to learn game dev on Unity and Unreal Engine!
- Im currently learning assembly language to further understand computer architecture
- I'm still clueless about what the programming world looks like, but I am looking forward to it ğŸ˜„
- You can look at my random projects. They may be useless, but I did have fun creating them.
