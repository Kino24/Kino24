- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kino24
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and programming in general!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and possibly C# because I really want to learn game dev on both unity and unreal engine!
- I'm still a beginner, I only started C++ 2 months ago and tried C# only for a few weeks just to try game development.
- I'm still clueless on how programming world looks like but I am looking forward to it ğŸ˜„
